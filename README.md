# RPS Game

Out of the blue I decided to work on an Rock Paper Scissors game. I had to do it for my python class a few semesters ago, but I decided to do it agin, this time with my newfound JavaScript knowledge. I always have a hard time figuring out what projects to work on when learning a new language, but I'm glad I thought about this one. As of this commit it's not done, so here are some things I need to do.

- [x] Look into clearing the screen after a certain point (sort of did that with the `console.clear()` method)
- [x] Add two player mode
- [ ] Maybe extend the game to more than just rock paper scisors
